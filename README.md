## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to detect tampering/fraud of PAN cards using computer vision. This project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the Id i.e. the PAN card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone is original or not.

For this project we will calculate the structural similarity of the original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by the user â€“ This is the soul of this project we will discuss it thoroughly later in this blog.

Similarly in this project with the help of image processing involving the techniques of computer vision we are going to detect that whether the given image of the PAN card is original or tampered (fake) PAN card.

## The steps involved in this project are as follows :
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Scraping the tampered and original pan card from the website
3. Scaling down the shape of the tampered image as the original image
4. Read original and tampered image
5. Converting an image into a grayscale image
6. Applying Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) technique between the two images
7. Calculate Threshold and contours and
8. Experience real-time contours and threshold on images
